Notes for week 1
================

-- Start with 9x9 board.

-- Superko rule to avoid repetitions.

-- Termination checking.  Consider "pass" as a separate move and look for cases
where passing doesn't lower success probabilities.

-- Go text protocol for interfacing with client programs (graphical interfaces).

-- Scoring algorithm.

-- Doxygen for documentation.  Document all major pieces of code.

-- Design documents (high-level view).  Include links to relevant papers.

-- Get databases of games if possible.

-- For 19x19: Joseki dictionary.

-- Try phone apps e.g. SmartGo.
